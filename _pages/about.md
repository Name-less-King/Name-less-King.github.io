About Me
======
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in [School of Data Science](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn), Fudan University. Now I am under the supervision of 
[Prof. L. Jeff Hong](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=stZYMd8AAAAJ&hl=en) and I collaborate closely with [Prof. Jiaye Teng](https://www.tengjiaye.com).



Research Interests
======
For research, I am broadly interested in using probabilistic and statistical tools to solve practical problems. Several directions that I feel excited about include
* Uncertainty Quantification (e.g. Conformal Prediction)
* Generative Modeling
* Risk Management
