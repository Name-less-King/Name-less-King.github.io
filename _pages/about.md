About Me
======
* I am currently a undergraduate student in School of Data Science, Fudan University. 
* My research interest lies in High-dimensional Data Modeling, Theoretical Machine Learning and Stochastic Optimization.
* But I'm not just achieving something in my major, I am also familiar with Ancient Chinese Literature, Philosophy of Mind, Marxist Philosophy and Economics, which helps me think deeper into my research.
* Now I am under the supervision of [Prof. Xuening Zhu](https://xueningzhu.github.io) in School of Data Science, Fudan University. We are currently working on Sparse Covariance Regression.
