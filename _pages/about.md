About Me
======
I am currently a third-year Ph.D. student in [School of Data Science](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn), Fudan University. Now I am under the supervision of 
[Prof. L. Jeff Hong](https://jeffhongliu.github.io) and I collaborate closely with [Prof. Jiaye Teng](https://www.tengjiaye.com).

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and listening to Rock, R&B, and Soul music. I am a huge fan of [David Tao](https://www.instagram.com/davidztao/) and the band [Wang Wen](https://www.instagram.com/wangwen_band/).


Research Interests
======
For research, I am broadly interested in using probabilistic and statistical tools to solve practical problems. Several directions that I feel excited about include
* Uncertainty Quantification (e.g. Conformal Prediction)
* Generative Modeling
* Risk Management
